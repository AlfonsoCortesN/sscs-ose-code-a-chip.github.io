    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates a standard-cell based obfuscation of an example digital circuit to protect against imaging tools.\n",
    "The obfuscator works by replacing cells from a netlist by cells with identical behavior but different layout.\n",
    "This obfuscation is performed in the post-synthesis digital circuit, and the rest of the steps are executed in a typical digital composition (ej: PnR, DRC, LVS, Simulation, etc).\n",
    "The alternative cells layout do not have a significant impact in area, but the timing and capacitances can vary a little, making Static Timing Analysis vary between the original circuit and an obfuscated one.\n",
    "The cell library was previously built and characterized with enough files to perform digital synthesis and implementation.\n",
    "As part of the demo, an additional imaging-reversal procedure is built by template matching, to try to recognize back the cells in the digital circuit.\n",
    "This demo is built for Skywater 130nm (SKY130)."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit security is a rising concern in recent years. The analysis of digital circuits to extract information has been a common ocurrence in reverse-engineering. Such analysis includes the extraction of a netlist from different stages of design and fabrication. Despite numerous intents to obscure and secretize the process in such stages, attacks always arise at the end of the production cycle. An attacker can perform decaping of a chip and perform image-reversal of a circuit in critical locations to extract information. This project is yet another way to prevent attacks from chip imaging by obfuscating the digital circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Standard cell library\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component of this project is an standard cell library which contains the obfuscation cells. These cells contains the same circuit but contains different layouts. To exemplify this, lets take a regular NAND cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "```spice\n",
    "* This file can be found in obs_demo/lib/sky130.lvs\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit contains 4 transistors, 2 NMOS and 2 PMOS. At the moment of creating the layout, there are different ways to arrange the transistors. In the case of the NAND there are 4 possible arrangements for a minimum space layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Arrange 1             Arrange 2          Arrange 3          Arrange 4\n",

    "\n",
    "This behaviour can be extended to other cells. In the included library, the cells are limited to 4 different layouts, but this process can be repeated as many times as different arrangements are possible for a cell. This is an example of a D-Flip-Flop.\n",

    "With these cells,  a library is composed which contains combinational and sequential circuitry. Such layouts are going to be randomly swapped in a netlist to obfuscate the digital circuit at the moment of producing a layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Obfuscation procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The obfuscation consists of perform synthesis, obfuscation, place, and route the circuit with the standard cell library. The next figure details the overall flow of this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Obfuscation procedure](assets/img/obs_demo_flow.png \"OBS flow\")\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting a netlist of the circuit from synthesis, the obfuscation is performed to the output netlist from [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys).\n",
    "The script contains a link list to replace the existing cells to any of the 4 possible alternatives (if they exist).\n",
    "The cell is chosen randomly using the `obs_demo/syn/tcl/aleatorize.py` script.\n",
    "For example, an instance of `ND2D1` can be replaced by `ND2D1`, `ND2D1_1`, `ND2D1_2`, or `ND2D1_3`.\n",
    "The output of this script is a obfuscated netlist, where all the cells are replaced with equivalent circuits with theoretical different layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps are included in the typical digital flow to output a macro layout.\n",
    "Placement, Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) and route of the circuit is done using the obfuscated library and the geometry abstracts.\n",
    "Such process are executed with [OpenROAD](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD) with scripts included in the project.\n",
    "The output is a definition file which contains placement and routing of the geometry abstract, which is used by [Magic](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic) to create a final layout GDS file. DRC and LVS can be also performed at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: The DRC and LVS do not work at this point, as the standard cell library does not pass DRC and has connectivity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Reverse enginering the circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the GDS layout of the digital macro, the user can perform a test for a imaging reverse-engineering of the circuit.\n",
    "Imaging tools are used to create a photo-like realistic image of the layouts of the digital macro, as well as every cell implemented in the obfuscated library.\n",
    "Afterwards, all the images are imported into a imaging reversing tool named [degate](https://github.com/DegateCommunity/Degate).\n",
    "This tool allows the user to perform imaging-reversing to a series of die photos to identify digital circuits and their netlists.\n",
    "The user can perform a template matching of the images of this demo to simulate an attack and evaluate the identification rate at a first iteration.\n",

    "\n",
    "This project implemented a digital circuit example (an aes core) with an obfuscation that involves an special standard cell library.\n",
    "This standard cell library contains different layouts of the same circuit.\n",
    "With this approach, the project is able to mitigate image-reversing of the circuit.\n",
    "The concept is partially proven by creating photo-like images of the layouts and the standard cells.\n",
    "Such images are fed into a image-reversing tool named `degate` which performs correlation detection in the different photos.\n",
    "If we suppose the attacker only has knoledge of the basic standard cell library, the attack is only successful around the 20% of the total circuitry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was possible thanks to the usage of an standard cell generator developed in the \"Universidad Industrial de Santander\" (Insdustrial University of Santander) in Colombia/Bucaramanga.\n",
    "I also want to acknoledge my current job at the University of Tokyo."
