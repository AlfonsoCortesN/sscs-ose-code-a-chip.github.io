# SiliconJackets Systolic Array
This notebook goes through the process of design specification, simulation, and implementation of a Systolic Array with open-source tools and PDKs. The parallel computation and data reuse ability of a systolic array is crucial for the acceleration of neural networks, and this notebook with the reusable design aims to contribute to the hardware open-source community to enable more efficient ML applications. This project will explain the principles behind how a systolic array operates 2D convolution, demonstrate the performance of our implementation with image results, and show the final GDS generated with open-source flow. Additionally, to further demonstrate the feasibility of the open-source flow and our design, we are also submitting this systolic array design to the open-source silicon initiative, [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/). This submission is completed by members of SiliconJackets. We are a student run organization at Georgia Tech that introduces students to semiconductor design, verification, and implementation through a large collaborative project. We are hoping to use this notebook as an example for future members of the club.
