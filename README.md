## IEEE SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem “Code-a-Chip” Travel Grant Awards at [ISSCC'24](https://www.isscc.org/information-for-students)


**The IEEE SSCS Code-a-Chip Travel Grant Award** was created to:
 1. Promote *reproducible* chip design using *open-source* tools and *notebook-driven* design flows and
 2. Enable up-and-coming *talents* as well as seasoned *open-source enthusiasts* to travel to IEEE SSCS conferences and interact with the leading-edge chip design community.

## Program Rules
- The program is open to anyone (no restrictions). IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) membership is encouraged, but not required. Teaming is encouraged, but each team must identify a single leader who can travel to the ISSCC from February 18-22, 2024, to receive the award and participate in networking events.  
- Applicants must submit an **open-source Jupyter notebook** detailing an innovative circuit design using **open-source** tools. The objective is to disseminate the main ideas and design choices using **open-source tools and PDKs** in a **reproducible** manner. Generating a final layout of your circuit is encouraged but not required.
    - Examples: [inverter](https://developers.google.com/silicon/guides/digital-inverter-openlane), [temperature sensor](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/temp-sense-gen/temp_sense_genCollab.ipynb)
    - Submissions of previous winners: [ISSCC'23](ISSCC23/README.md) and [VLSI'23](VLSI23/README.md)
- Each submission must contain a suitable **open-source license** (e.g., Apache 2.0).
- A jury will evaluate the submissions and select up to 10 winners.
- Travel grants of up to US$500 (for secondary students), up to US$2,500 (for undergraduate students), and between US$1,000-US$5,000 (for graduate students and all others) will be awarded. This award can be used to reimburse travel and a portion of your accommodations until the dollar amount is used up.

- Travel arrangements must comply with the [IEEE Travel and Expense Reimbursement Guidelines](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/travel-expense-reimbursement-guidelines.pdf) and awardees must attend the conference in person to qualify for reimbursement.

## Program Logistics
- The notebooks must be submitted through a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) at the [SSCS Open-Source Ecosystem Code-a-Chip](https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io) (OSE) GitHub portal.
- Notebooks submissions must follow guidelines in the **[How to Apply](howtoapply.md)** section.
- The winners are expected to attend the conference to be recognized for their awards and to present a poster.
- Reimbursement will be provided after the conference when registration, air and accommodation receipts are sent to the SSCS administrator.
