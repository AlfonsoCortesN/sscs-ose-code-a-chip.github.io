The parallel computation and data reuse ability of a systolic array is crucial for the acceleration of neural networks, and this notebook with the reusable design aims to contribute to the hardware open-source community to enable more efficient ML applications. This project will explain the principles behind how a systolic array operates 2D convolution, demonstrate the performance of our implementation with image results, and show the final GDS generated with open-source flow. Additionally, to further demonstrate the feasibility of the open-source flow and our design, we are also submitting this systolic array design to the open-source silicon initiative, [Tiny Tapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/). This submission is completed by members of SiliconJackets. We are a student run organization at Georgia Tech that introduces students to semiconductor design, verification, and implementation through a large collaborative project. We are hoping to use this notebook as an example for future members of the club."

Then, the hardware specification and design of the high level architecture and processing unit are explained.

        "\n",
        "A systolic array is a 2D array of individual processing elements, which can each independently compute. Systolic arrays allow massive parallel computation which is largely useful for machine learning applications which can require a large number of MACs (Multiply and Accumulates) that are not dependent on one another. This array construction not only allows the massive parallel computation abilities, but also facilitates data reuse which reduces the memory bottleneck. By scheduling operations correctly for something like matrix multiplication of 2D+ convolution, PEs that are next to each other may use similar data in their operations. Because of the PE arrangement, this data can be passed between PEs directly, which means it only has to be fetched once from memory. In this notebook we present a 3x3 systolic array which uses row stationary dataflow and show how it passes data between PEs for maximum data reuse and minimum required bandwidth."

        "### Convolutions and Systolic Arrays\n",
        "In the realm of signal processing and machine learning, convolution plays a fundamental role in various applications such as image processing, video processing, and digital filtering. A two-dimensional convolution (Conv2D) is a mathematical operation involving sliding a filter matrix over a larger input matrix to produce an output, which is a fundamental operation in many algorithms, including those employed in computer vision and machine learning applications.\n",
        "The convolution operation naturally allows for significant data reuse, as any value from the input, filter, or output matrices will be used many times in different multiplication/addition calculations (MACs). The key to exploiting this opportunity for efficient convolutions is to use highly parallel hardware to reuse data loaded from memory as much as possible before it's returned to memory.\n",
        "In a systolic array, data is loaded from memory and flows through a grid of identical processing elements (PEs), being reused differently in each PE over different clock cycles. The flow of data through the system can be compared to the flow of blood being pumped through the circulatory system.\n",
        "Systolic arrays are very useful for matrix multiplication (GEMM), and before the row-stationary (RS) dataflow was used, convolution operations were converted into large GEMM operations before they could flow through the array of PEs. However, with the modified RS dataflow which we implemented in our design, the systolic-like array directly computes the Conv2D of the input and filter matrix efficiently."

In this mode, each processing element computes a single output from a 1D convolution operation and then those partial sums are added down the columns for the final outputs. During the initial loading of the filter weights and row data, the full scratchpads need to be populated before any computation can occur, but as the convolution operation moves across the rows, only one new byte of data needs to be read per PE making this form of 2D convolution operation very memory efficient.\n",

A convolution may be able to pick out the edges of objects as shown in this notebook, or a chain of convolutions such as in a convolutional neural network may be able to filter out more complex shapes for object recognition or something like a dog. Using a systolic array to do 2D convolution is very quick and efficient which is why this hardware is the basis for many machine learning accelerators."

Once the PE sees a start signal it will spend 3 cycles doing MACs with the scratchpad values and then sum with the input psum. With the PE start signals staggered across the array, the psum_o for one PE in a column becomes psum_i for the PE above it with the top PE presenting a final value at the output.
