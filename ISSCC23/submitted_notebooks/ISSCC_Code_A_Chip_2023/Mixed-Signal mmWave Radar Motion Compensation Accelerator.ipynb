    "# Mixed-Signal mmWave Radar Motion Compensation Accelerator\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the design and silicon verification of a custom mixed-signal mmWave radar motion compensation edge accelerator engine implemented using the open-source SkyWater 130-nm process technology. The chip is designed to carry out edge-based, real-time inertial (IMU) sensor fusion for vibratory motion correction on a mmWave radar platform via a combination of custom analog front-end vibration parameter detection circuitry and a digital back-end motion deconvolution kernel generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture-wise, the IC contains an analog front-end, used to process the frequency and amplitude of the IMU-detected platform vibration, and consisting of amplification/filtering circuits, a frequency detection type-II PLL, peak detector and sampling circuits, and two 8-bit SAR ADCs. The digitized information is then processed by a back-end custom DSP engine responsible for formulating and storing the motion deconvolution kernel frequency response phase/magnitude data in a series of on-chip SRAM banks for subsequent serial readout by a radar interface controller. Thus, the chip is highly modularized, consisting of several adjustable/programmable analog/digital circuit building blocks (e.g., current-starved ring oscillator, PLL, amplifiers, filters, ADCs, SRAMs). Indeed, many of the blocks are tunable via off-chip inputs, allowing for integration and reuse in other custom designs for analog/mixed-signal and digital processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, through a completely open-source design and pre-tapeout validation process, the presented IC demonstrates how open-source tools and technology can be used in the modular design of chips for high-resolution and/or real-time sensing applications."

    "## Motivating Application\n",
    "Compared with alternative sensing modalities, mmWave radar represents an optimal vehicle for edge-based perception, given its suitability for 3D imaging and relative immunity to adverse environmental conditions. However, while the proposed mixed-signal edge accelerator IC is designed specifically for integration into multi-sensor mmWave RF systems, the circuit building blocks themselves and design methodology may be applied for any high-resolution and/or real-time sensing application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any reliable system design must address one aspect inherent in any active intelligent mmWave edge device and detrimental to signal reception: the motion of the sensor itself, an issue, for instance, with automotive vehicles, UAVs, and wearable devices, as well as other motion tracking applications. To account for such arbitrary or deterministic parasitic motion, the sensor must be capable of filtering and deconvolving the RX returns to generate a noise-free signal. Here, we consider the effect of vibration on the radar platform; sensors mounted on an automotive engine, for instance, would be highly susceptible to such motion. The designed chip interfaces directly with an auxiliary analog accelerometer/IMU, which serves to detect the frequency and amplitude of the platform vibration. Real-time on-chip sensor fusion, on time intervals of less than 100 ms (corresponding to the mmWave radar frame-level time scale), is implemented to generate a frequency-domain deconvolution kernel/filter that may be subsequently applied to the simultaneously collected radar data off-chip, yielding the final corrected signal returns."

    "### Analog Front-End\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in the figure, the designed IC takes as an input the highpass-filtered single-channel x-axis acceleration voltage-domain signal from an analog accelerometer. An input amplifier chain, consisting of a single-ended-to-differential converter and programmable-gain amplifier, converts the input into a differential signal and provides four different gain settings (0.5x-gain, 1x-gain, 2x-gain, and 4x-gain), programmable via two digital input bits that switch in or out capacitors in the feedback network of the differential OTA-based amplifier. The OTA itself is implemented via a folded cascode architecture with common-mode feedback. Filtering of the raw accelerometer input signals is achieved via an active lowpass $G_m$-$C$ biquad filter, with the individual transconductor stages implemented via a simple single-stage differential OTA with common-mode feedback Off-chip filter capacitors on the order of nF yield a corner frequency of approximately 500 Hz, thereby removing noise components above the low-frequency vibration band. The filtered acceleration signal is then distributed to the independent frequency and amplitude processing chains to assess the nature of the vibration. Frequency detection is performed by first converting the vibration signal to a square waveform via a continuous-time comparator. The buffered single-ended output is then passed to a charge-pump-based low-frequency type-II PLL, which serves to lock onto the vibration frequency, generating an analog voltage at the charge pump output proportional to the detected frequency. The PLL loop, with its off-chip $RC$ loop filter, is designed for a worst-case 1-percent settling time of less than 500 ms, corresponding to maximum magnitude input frequency step from 0 Hz to 64 Hz. In a typical platform motion scenario, therefore, in which input frequency deviations are not nearly as large or abrupt, the PLL ideally provides sufficiently fast settling. Meanwhile, the amplitude processing chain consists of a simple differential-to-single-ended converter, followed by a peak detector circuit that generates at its output a voltage level corresponding to the maximum signal level achieved during the given sampling interval. The analog voltage outputs from the PLL charge pump and peak detector outputs are then sampled and digitized via separate 8-bit SAR ADCs designed using a capacitive DAC and a latched comparator, with the separate synchronous ADC controllers synthesized in the digital domain."

    "\n",
    "The final mixed-signal design for the chip was generated using a combination of methods. To begin with, the LEF file outputs of the deconvolution kernel generator and SAR ADC controllers were instantiated in the analog top-level design *Magic* layout, thereby allowing for manual routing of the digital ports at the periphery of these blocks, as well as connection of the digital power rails to the corresponding analog M4 and M5 power rails. Hence, all top-level routing to the chip I/O pads was implemented manually using Magic, with custom ESD protection circuits placed next to each pad. At this time, DRC and *Netgen* LVS was implemented to ensure correct connection to all chip boundary pins and digital I/O ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the output GDS file for the top-level routed design (including all analog circuitry, I/O pads, ESD cells, and routing connections to the locations corresponding to the digital signal ports) was generated. A separate *Mflowgen* design was created to merge the top-level routed GDS with the generated GDS files for the individual digital SAR ADC controllers and primary deconvolution kernel generator. The design for this final mixed-signal merging step is located in the \"*digital_synth_pnr/chip_merge*\" directory of the GitHub design repository for the chip. The final merged GDS for the chip was thus generated and may be found in the \"*digital_synth_pnr/chip_merge*\" directory.\n",

    "A Digilent AD2 arbitrary waveform generator was used to synthesize a waveform corresponding to recorded raw accelerometer data for an interval of time corresponding to the window of radar data, while simultaneously providing oscilloscope functionality for analog front-end signal debugging. This single-channel data synthesized by the AD2 module acted as the input signal to the analog front-end, with analog control and bias voltages generated via external bias circuitry. A Zynq-7000 Zybo Z7 ApSoC/FPGA served as the primary output data interface and testbench control engine, monitoring the serial output data, output-valid signal, and evaluation-done signals generated by the on-chip digital deconvolution kernel generator back-end. Furthermore, the FPGA provided the clock input, ADC trigger signal, reset signal, load/debug/ADC-bypass enable signals used for SRAM preload and back-end debugging, serial input data, and SRAM select bits necessary for operating the custom DSP engine. The integrated ARM Cortex-A9 processor recorded all generated kernel magnitude and phase data, in addition to the ADC, transfer function coefficient SRAM, and phase/frequency vector SRAM readout data used for debugging and verification purposes. Correct timing for data collection was ensured via an interrupt-based synchronization mechanism implemented on the FPGA, which indicated when a new cycle of data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, at this point, it is pertinent to document an unexpected non-functionality of the chip analog-front end frequency detection PLL. Likely the result of layout-induced parasitics, which could not be fully evaluated given the absence of full $RC$-based extraction in the still-developing open-source tools, the charge pump output voltage was measured to be below the compatible voltage level for the SAR ADC comparator, resulting in a ring oscillator frequency well below the minimum frequency needed to achieve the PLL lock state. Unfortunately, absence of debug tap points within the PLL itself due to lack of available I/Os precluded any possibility of bypassing individual circuits within the PLL. Hence, the PLL was bypassed by simply feeding its input, i.e., the rail-to-rail output from the continuous-time comparator, directly into the FPGA, which employs a simple counter to determine the vibration frequency. A programmed $adc\\_bypass$ signal was integrated into the digital circuitry for debugging purposes to allow for manual setting of the ADC data via the serial input port, which proved useful here. Note that the frequency detection chain SAR ADC functionality was verified separately by directly driving the tap point at the charge pump output, and the amplitude processing chain achieves full functionality without applying any bypass in the digital back-end.\n",

    "The input clock frequency generated by the FPGA was minimized in order to optimize chip power consumption. Given a sampling interval of 95 ms, corresponding to the maximum on-chip resource consumption, the back-end DSP engine only needed to run at a rate of approximately 10-11 Hz. Approximately 42212 cycles were required to run the deconvolution kernel frequency evaluation engine while 20400 cycles each were required to output the serial magnitude and phase data, yielding a total of 40800 cycles. Thus, these two steps were pipelined, using the evaluation total time (i.e., the maximum period) as the pipeline stage time, yielding a required minimum clock rate of 444.3 kHz. For simplicity, the FPGA ran the chip at $f_{clk}\\!=\\!500$ kHz.\n",
