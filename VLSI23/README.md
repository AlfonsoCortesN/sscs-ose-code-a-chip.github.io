**The VLSI Symposium 2023 Code-a-Chip Travel Grant Award** is created to:
 1. Promote *reproducible* chip design using *open-source* tools and *notebook-driven* design flows and 
 2. Enable up-and-coming *talents* as well as seasoned *open-source enthusiasts* to travel to the Conference and interact with the leading-edge chip design community.
